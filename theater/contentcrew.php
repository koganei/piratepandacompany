		<h3>Cynthia Loutfi<br /><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 0.8em;"><i>Producer / Stage Manager</i></span></h3><br />
		Co-founder of the Pirate Panda Company, she has always had a passion for singing. However, it was almost by mistake that she did her first show in high school.  One day, without mentioning that she was auditioning, her teacher asked her to perform to assess her talents. A week later she was on stage singing Fairouz. Since then, she hasn't missed an opportunity to be on stage.

		<h3>Philippe Gobeille<br /><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 0.8em;"><i>Director</i></span></h3><br />
		He has been doing theater for more than 12 years and was part of his 50th show last Spring. Actor/puppeteer/dancer/singer, he also enjoys the backstage as director, set designer or light designer. From teacher or corporative M.C, Philippe is a Jack of all trades when it comes to a production. And it is with the greatest joy that he climbs aboard of the Pirate Panda ship to bring to the stage one of his favorite style of theater : la Commedia Dell'arte!
