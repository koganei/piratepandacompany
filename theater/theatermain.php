<center>
			<i>Who is Aristippus?</i> follows the schemes of Aristippus of Cyrene <b>(Maïza Dubé)</b>, a wanderer in search of parts to repair his robot servant, Harlebot <b>(Jonathan Cortes)</b>. Upon arrival in a small town, he meets the owner of a robot shop, Leon <b>(Mike Melino)</b> and strikes a deal with him to attempt to turn his lesbian daughter Sapphia <b>(Tracy Allan)</b> to heterosexuality in exchange for repairing the robot. Yet jealousy rears its ugly head when Sapphia’s servant Joan <b>(Natalie Chaya)</b> is stopped from attaining her heart’s desire. Based on the Commedia Dell'arte masks and mixed with a philosophical foundation, the play traverses interpretations of gender, humanity and automation to end in a transcendence of all these concepts, which are the naked beings that don all these masks.<br ><b>(Playwright: Marc Khoury, Director: Philippe Gobeille)</b><br />

			The play visually emphasizes this relationship between past and future<br />in our culture by adopting Steampunk themes. This movement, already gaining popularity, mixes our technological ideas with the ornate looks of the Victorian Era. The costumes were designed by <b>Lisa Abi-Chedid</b>, Montreal fashion designer, and the scenography by renowned artist <a href="http://www.jaberlutfi.com" class="theater_text"><b>Jaber Lutfi</b></a> and Concordia graduate engineer <b>Maxime Loutfi</b>.<br />

			<br />						
<b>Aristippus of Cyrene</b>: Pure hedonist, he adores drama and enlarges small issues to epic proportions. He walks and talks with swagger and confidence. He is sometimes more robotic than most.<br />
<b>Aristippa of Artides</b>: Pure hedonist, she adores to flirt with philosophical insights and sexual innuendos. Sometimes uses Harlebot for her needs.<br />
<b>Harlebot</b>: Robot servant of Aristippus, wants to be human. He is rather neutral in composition, his voice does not betray the sarcasm of his words. He moves a bit mechanically because of his material, but he isn't encumbered by it.<br /><br />
<b>Leon</b>: Shopkeeper of the 'Aye, Robot' parts shop. He is old and poor. He needs his daughter married and out of his house.<br />
<b>Sapphia</b>: Beautiful step-daughter of Leon, she leeches off him and refuses to marry, because she's a lesbian.<br />
<b>Joan</b>: Not so beautiful servant of Sapphia, she is in love with Sapphia, but cannot tell her because of rank.<br />
<b>John</b>: Intrepid mustachioed gentleman which shows his true face upon jealous moons.<br />
