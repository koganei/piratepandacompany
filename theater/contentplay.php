			This traditional comedy follows the schemes of Aristippus of Cyrene <b>(Maïza Dubhé / Jonathan Cortes)</b>, a wanderer in search of parts to repair his robot servant, Harlebot <b>(Jonathan Cortes)</b>. Upon arrival in a small town, he meets the owner of a robot shop, Leon <b>(Mike Melino)</b> and strikes a deal with him to attempt to turn his lesbian daughter Sapphia <b>(Tracy Allan)</b> to heterosexuality in exchange for repairing the robot. Yet jealousy rears its ugly head when Sapphia’s servant Joan <b>(Miss Sparrow)</b> is stopped from attaining her heart’s desire. Based on the Commedia Dell'arte masks and mixed with a philosophical foundation, the play traverses interpretations of gender, humanity and automation to end in a transcendence of all these concepts, which are the naked beings that don all these masks.<br />
			<br />
			The play visually emphasizes this relationship between past and future in our culture by adopting Steampunk themes. This movement, already gaining popularity, mixes our technological ideas with the ornate looks of the Victorian Era. The costumes were designed by <b>Lisa Abi-Chedid</b>, Montreal fashion designer, and the scenography by renowned artist <a href="http://www.jaberlutfi.com" class="theater_text"><b>Jaber Lutfi</b></a> and Concordia graduate engineer <b>Maxime Loutfi</b>.<br />

<br /><br />
<h3>Aristippus of Cyrene</h3><i>Maïza Dubhé / Jonathan Cortes</i><br/><br />Pure hedonist, he adores drama and enlarges small issues to epic proportions. He walks and talks with swagger and confidence. He is sometimes more robotic than most.<br /><br />
<h3>Aristippa of Artides</h3><i>Maïza Dubhé</i><br/><br /> Pure hedonist, she adores to flirt with philosophical insights and sexual innuendos. Sometimes uses Harlebot for her needs.<br /><br />
<h3>Harlebot</h3><i>Jonathan Cortes</i><br/><br />Robot servant of Aristippus, wants to be human. He is rather neutral in composition, his voice does not betray the sarcasm of his words. He moves a bit mechanically because of his material, but he isn't encumbered by it.<br /><br />
<h3>Leon</h3><i>Mike Melino</i><br/><br />Shopkeeper of the 'Aye, Robot' parts shop. He is old and poor. He needs his daughter married and out of his house.<br /><br />
<h3>Sapphia</h3><i>Tracy Allan</i><br/><br />Beautiful step-daughter of Leon, she leeches off him and refuses to marry, because she's a lesbian.<br /><br />
<h3>Joan</h3><i>Miss Sparrow</i><br/><br />Not so beautiful servant of Sapphia, she is in love with Sapphia, but cannot tell her because of rank.<br /><br />
<h3>John</h3><i>Miss Sparrow</i><br/><br />Intrepid mustachioed gentleman who only shows his true face upon jealous nights.<br />
