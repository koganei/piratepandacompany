<h1 name="chains">Chains (October 2009)</h1>
<pre>
The philosopher peered through his arcane instruments, built from cogs, gears and minds. He cogitated numbers and built novel thoughts using a variation of Leibniz's original arithmetic engine. The dense sulfuric vapors brought to mind the hermetic airs of shut-in winters and reawakened the demons invariably present to his hermeneutic self. Upon gaining insights into the elements of nature, they have been constant solvents on his soul, whispering the lies of the supposedly divine realm. The man opened a drawer and took out a cracked nut-brown box imprinted by the Bombay Cigar Company on which were scratched fierce intimidating messages. Inside were several feet of coiled wire of some exotic metal. The man proceeded to cut the string into finger-length parts, aligning them neatly upon a thin sheet of aluminum. Once two or three dozens of these were completed, he put the bundle back in its box and locked the drawer, pausing a moment to capture the results of his work. His lips sketched a tentative smile before he moved into the adjacent room.

	Inside a wide roaring mouth of stone lived an intense fire and on its lips lay certain tools required for such works. The man grabbed one of the metal pokers with burning-impaired gloves devised from a material discovered by his late colleague. Using them reminded him of a time when such works were social endeavours meant to help the People, rather than the solitary obsession with truths into which he now seemed to have fallen. But to revel in one’s own pains was easy, and comfortable; Change, on the other hand, is never easy, never comfortable. It is hard to come by, especially with no one else around to notice it. The troubling yells of his thoughtful demons redoubled as he approached the hearth. They commanded him to rest, to break, to let his life be lived rather than to be shoved into corners only to collapse. He vehemently shoved the poker into the diabolical furnace, quieting his unnerved mind. He let the fire lick the metal, catching his breath and then walked back into his laboratory ablaze with his obstination, dismissing muted, creeping whispers in his ear taunting him to drop his substantial quest.

	The fervent ideologist poured a flagon of quicksilver into a glass bowl situated on a rotating wheel, such that one might pour drops of its contents onto a fixed platform. He took off his gloves and dipped a finger into the warm silvery liquid. He put his fingers to his lips and smiled as he felt the liquid roll down his throat and revitalize him. He combined liquids and spices from many flasks and jars littered around him. The interim blacksmith proceeded to fashion the first bits of string into a loop by placing them on the platform and decanted a few drops of quicksilver to close the gap between the two ends. After ceremoniously fitting the gloves, He laid the burning rod onto the ring and saw the mesh solidify before his eyes. He fit another loop through the first hole and closed it up with the mercurial alloy. The philosopher spent the night in pious concentration fashioning a complex, superstructured chain, now a mix of married metals and scientific sweats. No physical sound in his laboratory except the hissing of melting metals on the platform and the constant ringing of the chain, but the ephemeral fiends went on, suggesting and taunting. It wasn’t until the sun shone through the cracks in the cornices around the doorframe that he lay his head on his cot so that he could continue his revolution with a clearer head; the next steps would be coarser and he longed to find the end of this truthful labyrinth. To cross such a line without moral questioning would be unthinkable, and he prayed for salvation even in his dreams.

	The man got up from his cot and walked to the sink, which was filled with brushes and blots of paint. He washed his face thoroughly, as if to make sure it was still his own under the grime and fatigue. Once finished, he opened a closet hiding behind an incredulous amount of panels and rods and took out a pedestal. He then crouched to search through large tin boxes stacked ambiguously inside the shelves. He eventually took out an antique leatherbound book on which was traced a large Islamic calligram forming the name 'Al-Chemy'. He then opened a drawer to retrieve a jar full of keys and took out a bronze one. He tapped the dust out of the lock on its side and inserted the key. Trying to see his way through the sudden burst of dust from the tired pages, he laid it open on the pedestal. Adjusting it under a brass magnifying glass in order to read the handwritten Arabic, he revised his list of ingredients, catalysts and calculations until he was sure (at least as sure as one can be in these circumstances) that the philosophy was accurate.

	He checked off the items on the lists one by one as he poured them into a wooden basin. He mashed them to make a paste with which he filled a ceramic mould. He took the latter and let it rest upon the fireplace in the next room. As he waited, he took the chain in his hands and inspected it closely. It seemed like an ordinary chain from afar, but upon closer inspection, the metal that made it appeared to have patches of dark red interlaced with silver dots. It felt rugged under his fingerprints, but every link had no trouble sliding against the next step of this logical concatenation of matter. Doubts murmured in his ears, revealing a hint of the metaphoricity of his deductions, the filling of voids with blank faith. This was no ordinary metal and it had taken him an awful amount of time to get his hands on such a rarity.

	The meta-physician pried the mould open on his desk and inverted it over an elevated structure under which burned a low flame. Removing the ceramic revealed a recipient of solid mercury, the first of its kind, the last step before the irrevocable one. He poured a flagon of the same liquid into it and brought another taste to his excited senses. He took the chain and placed it solemnly on top of the bowl. Taking a breath and looking up into the heavens, the blasphemous diviner dropped it slowly into the liquid metal. He watched microscopic bubbles rise up from the depths of the solution and heard loud cackling noises, as if his everlasting demons were laughing at his future hellish soul. He sponged sweat beads from his forehead with his sleeve and mumbled softly to himself. He saw the level of the liquid fall, and a knot in his stomach that he hadn't known he had, because it had been there for so long, seemed to untie and relieve him of the burden of skepticism. He noticed the shine, like a sun peeking from behind silvery clouds, poking its way through the ritual.

	He plunged his hands into the warm liquid and took out a chain made of solid gold. The bowl had worked, the chain had changed and he finally found himself alone in his godless laboratory. He straightened and heard the crisp flames of the fireplace vaporize the stains of quicksilver left on the grates, the slow tinkle from his sink as water rolled gently into an old bottle of yellow paint. An illuminating serenity washed over his face and he let a laugh escape from his throat. From the pit of his stomach surged a gut-wrenching howl that cleansed his irredeemable soul from all anxiety, gushing as tears down his merry eyes. He had finally obtained a truth and would never let go of it.

<h1><a name="escape" />Escaping is not very fun (February 2010)</a></h1>
<pre>
	I stand on the edge of the mountain cliff, my rifle resting on my shoulderpad. My mind mingles with the odours and colours of every particle of mist in the air coming from the large waterfalls overlooking the plains. Yet the landscape before me is so large its nature still escapes me. The eddies of the wind trouble a red-throated airdrone gliding clumsily along the horizon. Through the fog and inside the valley, there is a pair of shining lions. They are slowly circling a young zebra which seems to have lost its way and finds itself on the shoreline of a lake, cornered into an ambush. The lions' maws overflow with saliva as they approach their prey. Fear shines through biological eyes and I watch nature eat itself from the inside. Until I hear a voice behind me.
	"Trick or Treat, mate."
	I sigh. "What fresh hell is this?"
	The man before me has long, slinky legs, hidden halfway by torn grey shorts. He wears a famined beard, sprinkled with spices of all sorts. On his head is a fur hat whose two flaps are held upward like some homeless goblin's perky ears.  His boils and rashes move from neck to stomach, where they seem to have invaded his chest under his drudgey shirt. His grim-stained fingers are long and agile, and would move quickly to the blaster secured in his belt. What use is tech in front of a fatal blast? Left eye shot jet black, complete nanorejection. I shield my eyes against the sun rising behind him.
	"That eye probably hurt like hell, right? For like a year or two. That's what you get for going low-rate anyhow."
    He grunts while I kick some dirt under my boot, my rifle still immutable on my shoulder. The breeze running against my face is soft and smells of blossom. Behind the man stands another, a fatter man, but reeking of unsatiable hunger.
	"And him," pointing with my unused arm, "This one has feet to walk miles in two steps, large as they are."
	These two are not men to meddle with, not if you want to get out alive. I back towards the edge of the cliff and they approach obligingly. I risk a glance down and catch a clump in my throat.
	"Now, I know I ain't always been straight with you two, but you know I tried to do everything I could to help us out, right?"
    The tall man sniggers and spits on the muddied ground. Subtle laugh lines frame his otherwise sombre expression.
    "Yeah, like that time when you sold us to the slavers for your freedom?"
	The fat man nods behind him stupidly, running his hand languorously on his stomach.
	"Well.. that'd be the 'not straight with you' part, I guess."
	I was laughing, but the situation wasn't really all that funny.
	"Okay. Maybe I should've been up front with you about the whole slavery thing... But, you know, I thought you'd be cool ab-" "Remember what happened then?"
	Yes. Yes I do remember what happened then. I try not to, but I can't.
	"Then, we slaughtered them all and followed you up this mountain, now didn't we?"
    "Yeah, we did. And we barely ate, too. Dang planet doesn't have a single drive-through! Can you believe it? We could only catch three sparrows, two foxes, four slugs, fourteen scorpions..." The obtuse man continues to count his massacre on his fingers vacuously, walking in slow circles while the other runs his palm down his face in disgust, hiding his envenomed eye with putrid blue scars.
	"Bart. Shut up." He unclips his holster and puts his hand on his blaster. His left eye twitches manically. "Now, where were we?"
	Bart pipes up behind him. "Oh! Oh! Clyde! I know, I know. You said," He puts his hand on his stomach and takes on a mean, hollow voice. "'We followed you up this mountain for three days, now didn't we?'"
	"Shut up Bart. Yeah. Didn't we?"
	"Well, it appears to be so, but you know, there's a lot to be said about space and time and-" "And now, do you remember what's gonna happen?"
 	There's a glint in his eye, from my sweaty reflection.
 	"Well, this time... I take the opportunity."

	I jump backwards into the cliff and I pray to have calculated the location of the lake just right. I keep looking up and see Bart laughing and jumping while Clyde spits down at me. Okay, I guess it might be time to face fear and look downwards. Bad idea. Too late to position myself, I hit the lake stomach first and I hurry to dial down sensory feedback. I wince at the pain residue in my mind and swim back out onto the shoreline.
	In siege around the lake, a makeshift shrubbery awaits, built from the location-aware seeds of the original settlers. The self-kept grass paves the valley like an antique rug, self-aware textile biding its time interspersed with synthetic trees. There are those who believe that the network of roots and blades realizes mental content through sheer complexity, that it gives rise to qualia, emotion and all that comes with it. I like to think it's not. That at least some of the living are not waiting, or thinking, or apprehending their own position in the world. Not sad.
    Large slabs of ice float on top of the water, a result of the upriver glaciers connected around the globe. Terraforming crews long ago brought glaciers from passing comets. They smashed them into this rock and planted the stems necessary for human survival. Centuries later, here I am, in the middle of a makeshift jungle, getting tracked by two ruthless killers who would probably already be gunning for me if I had only wished them a good morning.
    Damn, lost my rifle. Bad time to play hide and seek. I plunge back into the lake and find it's been taken hostage by some algae. I free the rifle from the threat of rust and leave to find my way back to civilization.

    [How could I let this happen, Wedge?] I whine into my comm because I need to vent. [The fencer was right around the corner, I was ready to get him.]
    [He had the plans?]
    [I think so. I was just gonna nab the guy when Bart and Clyde caught wind of what was going down, had to dump the trace I had on him.]
    [How do we get it back?]
    [I don't know. I don't know where he is. I don't know how much they know. I should've seen them coming. I mean, look at them, they're not exactly the most inconspicuous duo, now are they? I feel like a fucking rookie.]
	I hit a nearby tree with a closed fist, not bothering to lower feedback. Sometimes it helps to feel the pain in my body, reminds me of why I fight. I watch the mesh of veins slowly repair the cracks I made on the bark and wonder when mine will.  
    [It's alright, MC. We'll get these two clowns, you know that.]
    [It's not just that. I feel... sluggish. Like there's interference in my mind or something. I don't know, it's hard to explain.]
	My handler stays silent, she doesn't know what to say. Or maybe she was judging me silently. Like she knows about my large potential to fuck up and she's scared that I'm going to find myself down on the wrong path. Or maybe that's just my own judgement.
    [How long has it been since you've eaten anything?]
    [You have access to my vitals, you know exactly how much I've been eating.]
    [Which is not very much.]
    [I know what I'm doing.]
    [Do you?]
    [Just... get a trace on these two and contact me. I'm going back to debrief the Boss.]
    [Hey, I'm just trying to help out here.]
    [Find someone who wants it.] I wave her out and hate myself for it. That knee-jerk reaction bypasses rationality completely as soon as someone tries to lend me a hand, tries to get in.
    The zebra carcass tainting the lake reminds me of where am I, of how evolutionarily-tuned jaws can still rival my armour. The lions and zebras were probably from some older Spinarian estate, rich owner brought himself some pets from the old world. Then eventually nature took over again. Who knows what else might be out there. I slow my pace and raise my attention to my surroundings.
    In the shadow of the large-leafed synthtrees, the jungle seems alit with fireflies from the glint of the trunks' metal veins. Hidden by the scaled bark, golden nanomachines accelerate photosynthesis and produce helpful proteins so that their leaves and sap can be used for subsistence. It helped wonders for the terraforming process, and it is now the sole type of tree found in most settlements around the universe. The network of interwoven branches blocks most of my natural field of view; I expand my attention further into the forest.
     There are some heavy steps at twelve o'clock, half a klick away, blocking my path. A royal Sphinx with a riddle of blood. The bullets in the rifle's chamber remain unusable until they decide to dry. I'll just have to do this myself. I need a trap.

	I am a lion, and I roar. I am a lion, and I roar. FOOD! I leap majestically in the air, claws ready. SLAP the food! Oh, no, just a leaf. I'm hungry. I am a lion, and I roar. I am a lion, and I roar. Smell. Of. bloOD! Run, track, run. blood blood blood. I see it! food food food. Looks like, smells like... a zebra leg. I know this zebra leg. I've tasted this zebra leg. More zebra leg! I catch it in my mouth and it runs merrily down my throat. Woah, I'm feeling dizzy, like the world is turning around me. But the food is so good, so so good. food is good. Why are my paws in the air? That is some strong zebra leg.

    I set a bit of meat at the end of the rope holding the net. A passing animal should come and eat it soon, cutting the rope with it. I hope it's not a small one. I'm sure Wedge and her Predator Gene Abolition group would have something to say about that.
	The synthtrees eventually give way to hard asphalt. The solar cells implanted in concrete gives the road a green hue that makes it look somewhat radioactive. A massive fortified wall stands perpendicular to the road, lost in both horizons. Two towers cover hefty iron gates blocking the desert, like a grate unto a roasting fire. I pick up a rock, just in case. Rocks can help in most situations. For pillows, or projectiles, or if you just need something to talk at. "Stay. Good rock." I pocket it.
   [Hey, Wedge. I've never seen those tower guards before.]
    [Probably a new rotation. Hold on, let me check the ledges]
"Hey you!" The red dot of a sniper dances on my chest from the shouting guard in the left-hand tower. "Drop the rifle! On the ground! Now!"
    [Too late.]
     A guard comes to frisk me, covered by another. He pats my pocket and lifts his black helmet gilded with the Sand Phoenix of the J'Hared. He seems troubled by the outside air, but stays in character.
	"Why do you have a rock in your pocket?"
    "Sorry, I left its license at home. Do you want me to send it to you later on? It won't bite anyone, don't worry. It's very well trained."
    [No need to antagonize him. We've got enough problems already.]
	"And what were you doing in the jungle?"
	"Oh, just gone for a stroll, taking in the scenery. Don't worry, this isn't human blood. I found a zebra leg a couple of klicks back. You're new here, right? What happened to the old guards?"
	"Orders from up top, they're revamping the entire squads. Apparently there were some untrustworthy folks among our ranks, the J'Hared decided to clean up shop a bit.  Papers?
    [Seems I'm better than your tech] and she tries not to laugh in the comm.
	He extends his hand and taps his foot while I pull out my ident from my one of my suit's pockets.
	"Revamping, huh? They do like their enemas."
	"We do."
	"Didn't mean to offend, enemas can be quite nice." 
	"Stay here."
	"Aye, aye."
    He shrugs me off and gives my papers to his colleague.
    [Intercepting paper check.]
    "Hey, guard! I'm gonna need my rock back."
	"You'll need what we tell you to need. Now shut up."
	His colleague hands him the papers back, "Papers checked out, Paul."
    Paul burrows his eyebrows and hands me Lil' Rockster back.
    "Very well, you may proceed. But I'm watching you."
    "Always glad to meet new fans."
    "Get the hell out of here."
	I pick up my rifle and make way past the gateway defending the desert moat around the J'Hared. Waving dunes extend further than the horizon and my eyes cannot reach the shielded Crystal city. I walk along the Eternal Sands, keeping an eye on my hydration levels. Following the heat signature of the hideout, I find the cooled plastic handle of the hatch buried in a dune. I enter the antechamber and welcome the cool breeze on my face. My suit might have kept me cool, but the psychological suggestion of the heat is not easy to shake. I knock on the inner door.
    "Were you followed?" Small darting eyes ask me behind a sliding steel panel.
    "Maybe."
    "I'm not sure I can open if you've been followed." The eyes look left.
    "Why not?"
    "They might know where we are."
    "They would already know where we are. They can't see you open the door now, Biggs."
    "That's true." Looking right.
    "So just open the door."
	"I don't know..."
	"Biggs, if you don't open the door right now, we're eating turtle soup tonight." His eyes widen with indescribable horror.
	"You wouldn't dare touch my turtles!"
	"Won't I?"
	He meeps weakly and the door squeaks open, letting in the soft yellow glow and the mild chemical smell of the evertorches. The cavernous sand walls preserved their ripples from the hardening process and stood as their own microcosmic desert. In that desert's sky were titanic beings amongst the blinking starlight and video feeds. An imposing one-armed man in a black and brown uniform looks down upon a hunched form wearing an oversized helmet protecting his fragile stature.
    "Biggs, are you the one who put fifty posts in the suggestion box, all asking for 'regulation gear'?"
	"How would I know, Boss? These things are anonymous. It could be anybody."
    Biggs pushes his helmet back onto his forehead. I sit on the black sofa behind Biggs' station and start composing my report, keeping an amused attention thread toward the conversation. The Boss raises an eyebrow.
	"Really?"
    "Yeah, it could even be you. Nobody knows."
    "Biggs. Was it you?"
    He swallows guiltily and looks down at his polished boots.
    "Well, it's just that Wedge always gets what she needs, and what do I get? Can't even get a helmet that fits."
    The Boss puts his hand on Biggs' shoulder and looks him in the eyes.
	"I'll get you a helmet, Biggs, next time we hit a big pay."
    "That's what you said last time."
    "Have we gotten a big pay since?"
    "No, but we never get big pays."
    "Exactly." He gets up and passes his hand through his grey hair while turning toward me.
    "So, MC, I hear your plan utterly failed."
	"How nice of you to put it that way."
    "Nice enough that I'm not kicking your useless ass out."
    He tries to cross his arms, but puts his hand back on the desk when he realises that he only has one arm.
	"Still attached to the old pump, huh?"
    "Damn thing's been longer in the shop than in my shoulder."
    "Get a selfhealing one, already. You're creeping me out."
    He frowns and looks away for a moment but I can't tell whether he's daydreaming or diving. He shakes his head as he focuses back.
    "Oh, we're still on this? Go get Wedge for the brief.  Biggs, get me some caffeine. Boss, sit down and relax. Yes, Boss. Right away, Boss."
	He sits down on his large swiveling chair, sets his feet on his desk and goes back to wherever he was. I find Wedge diving at her console, lost in her opaque simgoggles. I put my hand on her forearm and call out to her. The headgear gradually becomes translucent as her eyes start to focus on the world around her.
	"Oh, hey MC."
	"Anything on Bart and Clyde?"
	"Not yet, I thought I'd traced their signature in Jgaba, but it wasn't long enough to confirm it was really them or get an exact location."
	"Might be useful to check out anyway."
	Wedge takes out a nutrient bar from inside her desk and hands it to me.
	"Here, have a snack."
	I shrug it off. "I'm good. I'll eat later."
    "I've never seen you like this, I'm getting worried about you. Ever since you got caught by those slavers, you've seemed different." I don't want to think about the slavers. Don't want to think about the torture, the games. "I mean, it was already bad enough after your brother..." Why is she doing this to me? Doesn't she know it hurts?
	"Wedge. I've told you. I'm fine."
	"Then just eat it, for fuck's sake."
    She pushes the bar in my face and I instinctively slap it away, sending it clashing against the surrounding tech. Her head shoots back as if slapped herself and her green irises that look at me from behind her purple bangs turn a shade darker. I feel the shame following the anger, but I know they're simply biosignals. A way for my primitive brain to inform me of something. I turn my back toward the door and push the emotions back deep inside myself, where I can't get to them, where I don't think about them. I feel her stare on the back of my neck, even if my mind knows it's the heat release from my exocortex.
	"Boss wants to see us."
	"Maybe he'll upload some sense in that undernourished brain of yours."
    [Maybe.]
	We gather around the black glass conference table with the Boss heading the meet. Wedge is sitting between him and me, avoiding my gaze, with Biggs sitting across from us. The Boss passes a hand through his grey hair while he clears his throat.
	"As you all know, MC 's been undercover for the past few weeks trying to find out the truth behind the rumours of some alleged new tech being developed in the Bashwa region. Any information on this could be incredibly valuable for rival moons, as long as we get it quickly enough."
    At the mention of money, Biggs straightens up and starts paying attention.
	"It turns out that the rumors were real. There is indeed some hushed up project being developed and MC got pretty close to it, but was eventually unsuccessful in retrieving any sort of useful information on what the tech is or where it can be found."
	I avoid Biggs' crushed look, like he just learned that his favorite superhero was actually just a loony in a cape wearing his underwear on the outside. Wedge doesn't even turn around and keeps looking straight at  the Boss.
	"We know that Bart and Clyde were sent for the exact same purpose by an unknown employer, but they are now under the impression that MC got a hold of the plans and are now looking to get a trace on us."
	"Which is why our stupid superhero decided to run up a mountain for three days." Wedge turns halfway around and looks at me from the corner of her eye. Not enough to count.
	"Our stupid superhero had two thugs on his trail and wasn't supported by the appointed handler."
	"Well, maybe if our stupid superhero would listen to that handler once in a while-"
	The Boss slams his hand hard on the table, silencing us immediately. "The stupid superhero and the handler can continue their lovers' spat another time. Right now, we have a job to do.  We need to know who employed the two mercenaries and how much they know."
	Biggs pushes his helmet back onto his forehead. "Bart and Clyde are looking for MC, right? We could just put up a bait, and hope they bite."
	"Where do we put up the bait, though?"
	Wedge answers me but still doesn't turn around. "We can try the Jgaba market, it's the last place we've caught their signal."
	The Boss passes his hand through his grey hair. "Alright. Good enough for the moment. MC, you go to the market and look around. Wedge, keep an ear out on the public comm chatter."
	Wedge starts to get up to go back to her station. "Oh yeah, Boss, can I get a couple of creds to buy some new equipment?"
	"Sure, just wave me the receipt."
	Biggs stands up furiously. "Awh, come on! I've been waiting months to get new headgear and she can just ask and receive anything?"
	I get up and let Biggs and the Boss fight it out. I run a check on my equipment and prepare to leave for my mission.
	
	The settlements of the J'Hared are like the ruins of an oasis. Decay pours out from every window, from every sooth-faced settler throwing garbage on the backstreets clad in rags reeking of old, familiar desperation. Yet the sun that shines on the planetary shields is refracted into infinite rainbows unto the desert city. Decrepit streets and suntanned rooftops meld raging indigos and skylight blues, a festival of crystalline light. It seems to me a negative reflection, a hint of what it once was or maybe could be.
    The buildings, obscured by the dusty air, are packed mud roasted under the sun, with holes for windows and lacerated drapes for curtains. Craftsmen have managed to build tools from hardened synthtrees: carts, plows and swords. Building tech in these outbacks is a hard task, and only happens in the center of the settlements, in the inner circle, in the Bashwa Region.
    The focal point of all human activity on Corona planet is the Bashwa Airdrome, a soaring spiral building standing erect like a silver bullet shooting into space. I head toward the looming tower, looking around to see if I can catch a glimpse of boils and rash or a fat stomach. I try to lose myself in the swarm of Jgaba market, the Never-Ending. In long series of ever-changing pathways, money-craven guards stand in rows behind their shoddy counters and beg, brag or trade their wares to whatever comes their way.
    [Alright, keep an eye out.] She's in professional mode now, the Wedge on a mission is a completely different persona, sharing no feelings with her personal mode.
	"Wouldn't you like a pretty necklace perhaps?"
	A large man with morphing reflective tattoos almost runs me down with his cart.
    ]Yeah, I know. I remember the first time I came here, some guy sold me a map of the market with search filters and exact inventories.]
    "I've better, faster! An eyelash cam or two, sir?"
	[He didn't tell you that map was only valid for the next five minutes, huh?]
    Two women in a side-alley are either having sex or are extremely wasted on stimdrugs. Shades of red and yellow pass over them like a psychedelic dream.
	[Next thing I know, the stands move around, the streets change direction and my map goes blank. Damn thing cost me 50 creds. And good luck finding the crook who sold it to me.]
    "Ma'am, please come this way for the bargain of a lifetime!"
    [It's an initiation ritual.]
	A gang of scrawny children are running through the crowd, probably picking pockets and swiping ident cards from oblivious tourists. Selling them to ident-collecting corporations are the only chance those kids have at surviving. They live under the beauty of the Crystal city, but are too close to the ground to appreciate any of its wonders. They don't have something that could be destroyed, nothing that could be taken away from them. I wonder whether they're luckier than I was, in a way.
    "Cacao! Cacao! High-tech and Cacao!"
	I silence the surrounding noise and replace it with Fugue No. 34, the slow rhythmic ballad my brother had composed for my 12th birthday. The intellectual stimulation of contrapuntal tones helps me cope in bad situations. I synch my breath to the tempo and it's much better. The calm settles onto every nerve and tic as I watch crazed peddlers yell mutely at one another, like a mad ballet in an impossible asylum floating in space.
    Behind a juggler displaying his cortical prowess by using 64 balls and 8 hands, there is a man, wearing sunshades and a suit, looking at me. Is that seriously his cover here? A suit? He must be watching too much vid.
    I begrudgingly turn the sound back up and melt into the crowd. I tip-toe around him, careful, making sure his eyes never meet mine. He's looking around bewildered by my disappearance when I get behind him and set my hand behind his back.
    "Not an inch, not a word or my blade goes in your spine, clear?"
    He nods meekly.
    "Who sent you?"
    He glares at me, unable to choose between answering the question or staying quiet.
    "Answer the question."
    "I don't know. It was some fat guy. Some really, really fat guy. He was with this skinny dude, all fangs and blades, you know? I don't know, man, I don't know."
    "This is your first time doing this sort of thing, isn't it?"
    "Y-Y-Yessum, he gave me 500 creds to keep an eye out for some redhead wearing simgoggles and packing a rifle, and another 500 if I spot you. It is you, right? Didn't think you'd be a-"
	I grab his hair and pull his head back. His hair smells of coconut.
	"Okay, What's your name?"
    "I-I swear man, that's all I know."
    "Tell me your name!"
    "Gant! Gant! Arthur Gant."
    I whisper in his ear to increase the dramatic effect.
    "Alright, listen here, Arthur Gant. First, you're going to give me their contact info, then you've got about two hours to split from this piece of rock and head for better moons. If I ever cross paths with you again, and you're on the wrong side, I'll make sure you're buried in the ground you're standing on. Do we have an understanding?"
    "Y-Y-Yes! Get the fuck out! A-As soon as possible. I will. I swear. Ju-Just let me go. Please."
    I push him away and melt back into the-  "Wait!"
		I wait.
		"You're MC, right? The MC? The one who works for Davidsmore?"
 	   Get to the point.
	    "Woah. Meta. I didn't want to believe it could really be you. Dude, listen, it's an honour to have been threatened by you, really. Wow, wait 'til I tell the guys."
 	   "Congratulations."
    -crowd.
	    "Oh, can you sign an autograph? Damn."

I
	When I was born, my mother and father were still a young couple, looking upon their lives together with the same values of hope, love and serenity that many couples held in these times. They'd recognised themselves in each other, and wanted their child to follow suit. In so many ways, I was a part of them— I was looked upon as a receptacle for their good nature and optimistic attitude, for their unachieved goals and half-hoped dreams. The greying blank slate of my childhood was for them a nest of possibilities, each of which they had pushed me into, and from each they hoped I would hatch. I rejected them all. "Why should I play piano, Papa?" "Why should I learn tennis, Mama?" Frowns and questioning eyes followed my inquisitive incursion into the adults' motives and actions, prompting judgments of impropriety and insolence. My parents, defending their ability to raise their child as well as my honour, branded me a "wild soul" and, perhaps apologetically, they would brag my "thirst for knowledge" and tout me "a genius in the making". Yet they could not understand my reluctance to their numerous attempts at finding something that I would like to pursue.
    On Christmas, when they could afford some extravagance, they would bring me plastic building blocks or an action figure. Thanking them politely, I would unknot the ribbons and carefully remove the wrapping paper after cutting the small strips of tape. I had given much work to the smile following such gifts. it needed to show enough teeth so as to be convincing, but not so much that it seemed forced. Projecting their own hopes onto me, they would be satisfied and let me go to my room to play with my new toys. I would inspect the gift thoroughly for a day or two, seeking to understand every part and every movement, linking this knowledge to other mechanisms I had previously inspected and finally stored them in the back of my closet with the other long-term entertainment failures. My mother would perhaps take notice of its absence and fear that I had not appreciated the thought and money they had put into it. "I'm finished with them." She would eye me for a moment then remember some other task that needed worry and proceeded to it.
 	My seeming servility toward my elders is a vestige of my father's iron-fisted rearing. My earliest memory of him was at my baptism, which is now rather a stock of blurry impressions reconstituted from fainting recollections and the plethora of videos and photos my mother had taken in her excitement toward her young progeny. As they believed I was the heir of all sins of the human condition, as all Catholic children were, my father and mother brought my primeval body to Our-Lady-of-Salvation, the local church where my father served as an Acolyte during the usual Sunday mass. Even before my birth, they had provided me with a role, a place in the world where my actions would have meaning. Each kick or sigh was for them a miracle, a gift provided from the Lord under their care and in which I had no choice. Were I to cry, they would inquire to satisfy my desires. Were I to laugh, they would reciprocate and delight themselves with my joy. And so, on the day of my baptism, as I was carried toward the altar, friends and family sitting in the nave of the church looked on. Their vision of me, as this vaguely human entity waiting to be introduced into their world, kept them locked onto my every movement, trying to project from my actions what sort of man I would turn out to be. Would I be a strong and honourable man or would I bring shame and remorse to the community? Yet the lingering image of my father, judge above all judges, looking down at me through his stern green eyes through the refracting holy water, is the one I saw in him throughout my entire childhood, standing solemnly dressed in his retired military uniform in front of the congregation. From my mother's tapes, it appears the reception was held in our backyard, wherein they planted a large sycamore tree, to help oversee my Faith.
    At the age of four, I had already learned to climb it and began to spend most of my days on that tree. I would study the waving ripples of the bark. I would inspect the fractal veins of the sweet-odoured fig-leaves. I would wonder and ponder about everything and nothing. I would be happy.

	My mother was a simple woman. Raised in a small village, she had learnt to trust her neighbours and open her heart to the world. This simplicity, while appearing as insipidity in lesser people, she used as an effective weapon for good. If the world around her was too large to comprehend, then at least she could limit her efforts to the people around her. Honing her Catholicism toward servitude and compassion rather than metaphysicality or authoritarianism, she enticed her surroundings to reflect the love of life with which she lived everyday. She taught me how to live an authentic life, to stay true to a foundation of moral beliefs around which to build the natural concepts of the world.
	On those early afternoons of my seventh summer, when the lazy air suppressed my motivation and left me with a strange mixture of boredom and relaxation, my mother would give me a book or two that I would read when perched in my sycamore while she arranged the backyard before the regular visits from the community, making sure that the water ran clean and the table was neatly arranged. Soon, adults in couples would come and drink coffee with my parents, laughing and joking until the sun started to set and the temperature dropped. My father would then proudly light the brick oven he had built the year before, but still brought my mother a shawl or a light blanket to cover herself. My father had brought me a reading light back from one of his travels, and so I could read on my tree while he told tales of his travels as a military medic to the guests. This comfortable routine repeated itself day after day, until, sometime in late summer, the head priest from the church gave an impromptu visit to my father.
    From my tree, I saw the red-faced priest come rushing into the backyard, brandishing his cane. Two couples of the community were already visiting, but he asked to speak to my father immediately. My father apologized to the visitors, gave my mother a knowing nod and retired to his office with the priest. Unable to resist the temptation, I left my tree and followed them into the house. As I approached the office, I heard my father's angry shouts over the priest's calm, calculated voice.
	"Did the Lord not preach for helping your brother?"
	"Do not quote the bible at me, boy. You have to help your child and your wife, not them."
	"Then who will? We cannot afford the losses, we've already lost more men than we can spare."
	"O Atlas, how miserable you must be." The priest cackled and tapped his cane on the marbled floor. He clucked his tongue and continued, "Be wary of sin. Is that not what I've taught you?"
	During their conversation, I accidentally knocked over one of the porcelain flower vase along the corridor which brought my father to the door. He looked down at me with those stern green eyes and asked me whether this was the way I was raised, eavesdropping on others like some lowly thief. I can still feel the back of his hand on my cheek, and the burning sensation of mangled shame and pain. As I sat there amidst the dying flowers on the wet floor, I had felt like the lowest being on earth, not worthy of anything, not worthy of him.
	My eighth birthday came a few weeks later, my mother, always in a communal spirit, had invited everyone in my class. In her defense, I had not talked about any friends and none had ever called. Still, there was a drop of excitement underneath my fear. These children who had not paid attention to me at school were now all coming together under my name. While I did not dare hope it would change much to our dynamics, perhaps it would soften their behaviour toward me, to somehow acknowledge my presence. The apprehension before the party grew intensely as it grew nearer, the unbearable promise of possible change, budding in my heart, slowed time down to a trickle, until, after the millions of change in my level of expectation, after the weight in my gut made me wonder if the wait was even worth it, after the suffering of living in the past of the expected moment, it surprisingly entered my life and produced a strange new being with whom it took a while to be acquainted.
    My mother had me weed out the lawn so the house would look presentable to our guests. She had taught me this skill the summer before, when she got tired—or jealous— of my tree lounging. While I resented doing it, it taught me a certain communion with the earth. With my hands in the same damp soil that covered the entire planet, the sublimity in the face of the omnipotent universe against my lone, small growing being was both humbling and aggrandizing. Yet I was still a part of that mass of actions, itself ready to be bent and harnessed to my ends.
    The kids came sooner than I had hoped, only affording me a few minutes on the sycamore. They came with gifts and laughter, parents and alcohol. My father greeted them warmly, dressed still in his uniform, grinding a cigar between his imposing teeth. I sat and played shyly with the others in the garden, with plastic trucks and fake pistols. During a ball game of some sort, I ran to catch a fouled ball and, in my excitement, vaulted toward the buffet table to catch it. As I was about to crash into the table, a blonde boy placed himself between me and my landing spot. As we both sprawled to the ground, he rolled over and stood up, dusting his clothes. The boy, perhaps a year older than I was, looked down at me with deep green eyes. "Hey, watch where you're going." He said unapologetically, but purely and softly, without blaming me and added "Hi, I'm James." I sat on the ground, stunned, clutching the grass around me, looking for words. He kept his gaze for a few moments and said, "You don't talk, huh? Boring. I'll go find someone else to play with then." He turned around and went back inside the house, hands in his pocket. My mother walked past me, asking the priest if he had seen my father. He said he had not.
    My mother called me to the buffet table where they had set up the cake. Her eyes were redshot and she held herself tightly against me, as if she never wanted to let me go. The others gathered around the table, laughing and carousing in the anticipation of cake. "Where's Papa?" My mother suppressed a sound and the priest told me he had gone to fetch some things for him, and that we should continue celebrating. I looked at my mother and she nodded hesitantly. She opened her mouth, but suppressed the urge to say something, ending with a tap on my shoulder without meeting my eyes. My uncle started singing Happy Birthday and the rest followed on.
    For the following month, any questions about my father were quieted and my mother would only give me the quizzical response, "He's helping people, God bless his soul." She would worry around the telephone, picking it up and hanging up hurriedly after dialing a few numbers. She would sometimes complete the call and ask for the head priest at the church. When she seemed to have reached him, she would enter her room and come back with puffy eyes and a red nose. She would hug me tightly and pray for strength.
    One afternoon, I was lazily observing the clouds from a lower branch when the door rang. I went inside to see my mother open the door to the head priest who looked even more serious than usual, more rings under his eyes than usual. He told my mother that he had some bad news. I learned then that my father had gone back to the front, against the priest's admonitions. A stray shell had exploded in his clinic.

    Without my father's eyes, life became an unconnected series of actions, failing to uphold any sort of moral basis. Without my father's eyes, I was at a loss as to how I would need to grow up, what sort of man I needed to be. My mother, while she held the best of intentions, did not have the sort of hold my father had over me. A hole started burrowing in my heart and rendered it a hollow shell, a purely mechanical organ with no room for trust or compassion.
    During the following years, I grew to be a bitter adolescent. At war with myself and the world, I was too blinded by innocence to realise the cause of my distress. The actual problem was quite straightforward once realized, and I am sure I would have resolved it sooner if the circumstances of my life had been different. As I was then, I could not see the key that I had to find within myself: I had not been inculcated in the cycle of a reward system. I did not have anything I was striving for, that made others go on with their activities. There were many that subscribed to a reward system based on procreation, on their tightly held ideal of family life, making sure their seed grew strong.  Every action that moved them toward that goal became rewarding, and permitted to assign worth to themselves and their endeavours. Myself, I was unable to complete this train of thought in which the ultimate effect of an action I've posed started to seem worthwhile. I was too misguided to see that the actions I posed were optional and that life itself did not need me for any purpose. Only other men pretended to impose a role, but yet lacked the means to make it absolute. There was no will, no power, no force in the universe which could extort from me a judgment I had not willed myself. Of course, if I had been able at that age to follow such an idea to its end, I would've laid my anger aside and revelled in the freedom it would have imparted.
    At the time, however, my boiling anger toward an unjust world brought me to the verge of failing school, even though I could have passed if I would have only applied myself. I couldn't be bothered. This rejection of the realm of interpersonal relationships brought me in constant detention, for arguing with teachers or fighting with other students. I was sitting in the back of the detention hall, watching the few remaining leaves fall from the tree outside the window when someone knocked on the classroom door. A boy with near-white hair entered the classroom, passed his detention slip to the teacher and looked around to find a place to sit. He noticed me and smiled knowingly. The pure green irises that looked at me brought me back to my eighth birthday, brought me back to the time of hope and safety I had long forgotten and did not want to remember. The pang in my heart heightened as he sat next to me and waved. "Hi, I'm James. I was sent to detention for peeking in the girls' bathroom. You?" He rubbed the back of his head and grinned at me. He seemed so comfortable with who he was, so at ease with the judgmental looks from the few girls sitting around us that I could not understand how such a person could exist, much less find any sort of interest in me. Even after having told him my name, he did not seem to remember my birthday party, and I myself was not entirely certain the boy from my childhood and he were the same— even though I preferred to believe he was.
    We would then meet almost every day in detention. On the days where one of us had not been caught outside of the rules, we would make fake detention slips and go to the hall anyway. While we could have just as easily met anywhere on the school grounds, there was something about the calm detention room that brought us closer together, a way to be part of our own group, following rules that did not apply to the rest of the world. We harnessed what the school thought as punishment and bent it to be a moment in the day to look forward to.
    After a time, my name and his had become synonymous throughout the school. While James had a much more outgoing personality, I hid in his shadow and lived vicariously the interpersonal relationships I had cast off through my one and only friend. When a student or teacher would come to speak to me, James would interfere on my behalf and say what I could then only dream of saying. He understood me so well that, in a way, he had become an extension of my own will, an exobody that would act with more assurance and more warmth than I ever could.
    He decided, one day after detention, that he would come over to my house and see where I lived. When my mother saw that I had brought back a friend, she ecstatically proclaimed she would cook a feast and ran back into the kitchen, whistling a happy tune. I showed him my room and my sycamore, we ate enormously and, when the sun had cast us back inside, played video games until morning. Our discussions usually centered around two things: video games and science fiction. We both understood the progress that man could undertake and we often wondered about the many ways in which humans and society could become better. We would speculate about the future, adding robots and implants to all possible scenarios. "Imagine if we could sense new colours, new sounds!" "Or if we could levitate stuff with our minds!" "What if we could share minds?" While it bred a common interest, it also resulted in a certain contempt toward the current state of humanity. I started to become angry at my limitations, at my shortness of memory or at my inability to express myself. It was my body's fault: I was not able to generate enough will to do what I wanted. James validated my salvaging thought: it was not my fault, it was an accident of birth. Had I been born somewhere else, at another time, perhaps I would not be this way.
	Later that night, as he was lying in a sleeping bag next to my bed, he spoke softly in the dark, over the rustle of the curtains against the soft breeze coming from outside.
	"I'm glad I came here tonight."
	"So am I."
	"My dad, he's this biologist, and he studies the brain with computers and stuff. But he never wants to talk about those things. Whenever I ask him about work, he just says 'it's work.' Like he doesn't even like it." His voice became muffled as he turned his face away from my bed. "I want a job I like, when I grow up."
	"Why do you want a job at all anyway?"
