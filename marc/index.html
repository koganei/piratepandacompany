				<i>Some thoughts from Marc Khoury circa 2013</i><br />
				My first foray into drama. I think it allowed me to understand the essence of what I enjoy in theater, and more generally in my writing. Further than my opinions on technology, a further philosophy appeared to me through commedia del'arte. The essence of play and disbelief are central to my relationship with the world, and I try to pass my own opinions through this movement.

				<i>Some thoughts from Marc Khoury circa 2013</i><br />
				I've rifled through my older writings and found these three pieces that I think can help show a certain development of voice over 2009 and 2010. I still enjoy reading them now. I'm not sure how I'll feel about them in a few years.

				<i>Some thoughts from Marc Khoury circa 2013</i><br />
				Along with the play came my first try at a longer, more involved story. I have about 12 more chapters still in my computer waiting to be polished and published. Even though I have little hope I'll actually go back and do it, it has taught me a lot about the voice and style I respond to. I'm constantly trying to adapt moments and feelings I have received from other sources, and trying to make my readers feel those through my story. And rather than eclectic trove of memories, my characters can sow threads between them, and make for myself a web of my past.

				Switching from Computer Engineering to Creative Writing was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Through learning literature and philosophy, I've been able to round up my education, and I now see a much clearer view of history, our present and our future. It allowed me to recognize my own beliefs, and to find ways to shape and express them with technology.

				A forum on which many people could come together and create comic books live on the site. A person would print out an empty comic layout and draw the first panel in, then scan it and upload it. Then another person could come and upload the next panel, and so forth in order to create a final comic made by many people around the world. It was my first time working in a team while coding, and it was great to see a final product. <b>Unfortunately, the site has now long been offline</b>

				<i>Some thoughts from Marc Khoury circa 2013</i><br />
				From all the things that I have coded before I started doing it professionaly, these are probably my favorites. The hangman game was simple and elegant, and was made purely to explore how frames and windows worked in javascript. While the Machines website was a foray into design elements and how to use the browser to evoke emotion.

				I've been working on Netforge with my brother since I was 13, when the web was only bursting out of its shell. We started building websites and managing networks for our friends and family, then moved one further to bigger communities like churches and school associations. We now build websites for small businesses to supplement our income and keep up to date on the state of technology.

				My first job right out of school, it was a very small business with only 6 employees, working out of the boss' basement. I was thrown into the deep end and asked to support clients right away, and I hit the ground running.
